# Remote Patient Monitoring System

> Readme and the project are still a work in progress.

This is a companion app for the RPM System which me and my team are building for our Graduation Project, 2023.
It's an app for doctors or care providers to monitor their patients' health, state, and remind them of their medication. As well as to monitor their house for extra safety (only heat and gas sensors for now).
